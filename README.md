# hack.v

A reference implementation of Hack — the 16-bit von Neumann computing system
that is described in the excellent [From Nand to Tetris course][1] — built
from scratch in Verilog.

## Prerequisites

In order to build the source files of this project you will need a Verilog
compiler. One of the most popular Verilog compilers, and also the one that has
been used in this project, is the [Icarus Verilog][2]. You can get the source
code as well as installation instructions of the Icarus Verilog from the
linked GitHub repository.
